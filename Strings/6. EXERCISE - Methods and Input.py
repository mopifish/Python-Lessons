""" 6. EXERCISE - String Methods and Input

	Cornelius Philips, your favorite and only boss, recently fired his secretary. 
	Convinced that 'employees are a waste of money', he's once again turned to you
	to do his dirty work.

	You barely manage to keep up with your work as is, and all this added secretarial 
	duty will only drag you down further! So, being the computer wizz you are, you've
	decided to program an automatic secretary

	after extensive market research, you've found you only need to respond to emails
	containing the words "money", "diamonds", and "oil". Everything else can be responded to
	via automatic response. 

	For this assignment, use print the "automated response" string for automated responses,
	and print something unique for every other option.

auto_response = "Thank you for contacting Mr. Philips. Unfortunately, your problems are not meaningful to us. Thank you, have a good day."
