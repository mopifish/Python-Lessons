# What Is Logic?
# Logic is reasoning that adheres to strict rules
# Another defintion of logic is "The study of correct reasoning"
# People use logic everyday, it's how our brains naturally think!

# The specific type of logic we'll be using today is 
# Deductive Reasoning

# Deductive reasoning is the process of deriving conclusions
# From general information or facts. For example,

# If K > 10, then K > 2
# K > 10 
# Therefore, K > 2

# In the above example, we established a rule: If K is greater than 10,
# it must also be greater than 2. We then stated K is greater than 10,
# So we are able to use logic to deduce K > 2!

# We can abstract this example to get the following format:
# if p, then q. p. Therefore, q.

# Here are some more examples that follow that format:

# If the sun is up, it is daytime
# the sun is up
# therfore, it is daytime

# If the program is printing, it is running
# The program is not printing
# Therefore it is not running.

# The "if p, then q. p. therefore, q." is deductive reasoning because
# it relies on existing  true facts to deduce a solution.
# We KNOW if p, then q. Since p, we can deduce that also q.
