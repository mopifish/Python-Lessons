""" String Problem 1 


Your boss, Cornelius Philips, is hosting a ball at his manor. 
As customs demand, each and every attendee needs their own name card. 
Mr. Philips has a guest list, but having to cut out each and every name card
would be such a chore!

In order to impress your boss, and hopefully get an invitation to this ball,
you've decided to make his life a little beat easier. 

Using the guest list below (which you scanned into your computer, and extracted the text from), 
write a program that'll get the first name of every guest from the guest list.

Luckily for you, evry guest has a name of the exact same length! Must be one weird party """
