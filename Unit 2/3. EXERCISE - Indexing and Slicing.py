""" 3. EXERCISE - Indexing and Slicing

Your boss, Mr. Cornelius Philips, has recently received a strange letter in the mail.
Although it reads normally, he can't help but feel something is off! After careful study, 
and much thinking, he's deduced that it contains a hidden message.

He's noticed that every th letter of the 2nd sentence is weirdly out of place,
and was wondering if they might form some sort of secret message.

Cornelius Philips is a busy man though, so he's passed along the dirty work to you.
Being equally busy, you've decided to write a simple python program that'll decipher this 
secret message for you! 

Good luck, and dont forget to impress your boss.

Dear Mr. Philips,

Please forgive my intrusion, but I was writing to inquire about your latest product. 
Your prodhuct the "esuper saplper" has psapped a  little tomo superbley, and se ems to ha!ve drained
my oak tree all the way to the roots. I was hoping I might secure some recompense for this,
since it has been in my family for generations.

Best,
Fredderly Chupps
